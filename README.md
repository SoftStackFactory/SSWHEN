```
npm install -g ionic
```

### Branches

SSWHEN employs a git flow methodology for branch naming. When creating new branches, work off of develop only.

`master` - Current release working production branch

`develop` - Next release development branch.

For new features, use the convention: `/feature/**feature-name**`

For hotfixes, use the convention: `/bug/**bug-name**`

```
git clone https://github.com/SoftStackFactory/SSWHEN
